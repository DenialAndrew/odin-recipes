    <p>
        "We have made this several times and everyone gobbles it up," 
        raves Kim. "I took the advice of others and used a combination 
        of cheese instead of just Cheddar. There is never any left!"
    </p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2 (10 ounce) cans chunk chicken, drained</li>

        <li>2 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup ranch dressing</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>1 bunch celery, cut into 4-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) box chicken-flavored crackers</li>
    </ul>
